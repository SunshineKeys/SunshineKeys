## 🌞 Hey, I'm Sunshine.

**Former Pharmacy Technician turned Healthcare Data Analyst** — with 6 years of hands-on pharmacy operations experience and a growing toolkit in Python, Pandas, and SQL.

I spent years on the ground floor of healthcare — processing Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial claims, handling workers' comp and DME billing, managing prior authorizations, and reconciling pharmaceutical rebates at **Change Healthcare** for Iowa Medicaid. I know what pharmacy claims data looks like from the inside because I've lived in it.

Now I'm building the technical skills to analyze that data at scale. I write Python scripts that automate what I used to do by hand, and I'm working toward roles where my pharmacy operations knowledge meets real data analysis — because someone who understands both the data AND the workflow it came from is hard to find.

## 💊 What I Bring to the Table

I'm not a fresh grad learning healthcare from a textbook. I've got years of experience in the systems these roles support:

* **Pharmacy claims processing** — Medicare Part D & C, Medicaid, commercial, workers' comp, DME
* **Rebate reconciliation** — manufacturer discount agreements, payment variance research, invoice validation
* **Formulary & prior authorization** — drug tier structures, coverage determinations, PA workflows
* **Billing & coding** — ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS, NDC, fee schedules, claims adjudication
* **Team leadership** — consistently trained new techs, interns, and managers; turned a failing retail location into top 5 in the district within 2 months

That operational knowledge is the foundation. The Python, SQL, and Pandas are how I'm leveling it up.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

Remote healthcare data analyst, pharmacy analyst, or claims analyst roles where my pharmacy operations background isn't just a nice-to-have — it's the whole point.

I'm especially interested in PBM companies, health insurers, and managed care organizations where someone who understands pharmacy claims data from the ground up can make an immediate impact.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always happy to talk with people in healthcare analytics, pharmacy operations, or anyone who values bringing real-world experience to data work.
