🌞 Hi, I'm Sunshine — Learning Python with a Technician’s Eye and a Service Heart

I'm transitioning into Python development after years spent in roles where focus, communication, and reliability really mattered.

I worked 7+ years as a Pharmacy Technician, which taught me to be detail-oriented, follow structured workflows, stay organized, and maintain accuracy even when things get busy. I also spent time in service industry and retail, where I learned how to adapt quickly, support others, and stay steady under pressure.

All of those experiences are shaping how I approach coding — with patience, care, curiosity, and a commitment to learning things the right way.

I'm still early in my journey, but I'm genuinely excited about developing consistent, dependable skills in Python and building tools that actually help people.

🚀 What I’m Working On

I’m currently in an 8-Day Python Hireability Sprint, building one project per day to strengthen my foundations through hands-on practice.

### Completed:

In Progress:

More small automation tools, organizers, and real-world beginner projects coming soon.

🧠 Skills I’m Building

Python basics & clean code

File handling and text processing

Command-line tools

Git & GitHub

Debugging and problem-solving

Workflow thinking & structure

Early automation concepts

I like understanding why something works, not just how to write it — and I’m building that understanding one project at a time.

🌱 Why I’m Moving Into Tech

After working in service roles and pharmacy environments, I realized I wanted a path where my natural attention to detail, steady work style, and love of learning could grow into something long-term.

Remote development allows me to stay consistent, focus deeply, and keep improving every day. I’ve set up a home workspace and I’m dedicated to building my portfolio, my skills, and — eventually — my career in Python development.

🤝 Nice to Meet You

I’m always open to connecting, learning from others, and sharing this journey with people who enjoy building things or improving themselves one step at a time.

Thanks for visiting — more projects soon. 🌱💛
