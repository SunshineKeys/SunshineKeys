🌞 **Hi, I’m Sunshine — Python Developer in Transition with a Technician’s Precision and Service-Driven Work Ethic**

I’m building a career in remote technical and dev-adjacent work, bringing together a strong foundation in **workflow accuracy, structured processes, and calm, reliable problem-solving**.

I spent over 7 years as a **Pharmacy Technician**, where consistency, attention to detail, and clear communication weren’t just preferred — they were essential. Those environments strengthened my ability to:

- follow structured systems
- maintain accuracy in high-volume settings
- support teams and customers with care and professionalism

That same mindset now guides my technical work. I approach development with **discipline, curiosity, and process awareness**, and I focus on building tools that are useful, maintainable, and thoughtfully designed.

## 🚀 Projects & Technical Growth

I’m currently working through an **8-Day Python Hireability Sprint**, building one project per day to strengthen structured thinking, automation fundamentals, and real-world scripting skills.

### Completed Projects

- **Day 1 — Text Analyzer (CLI tool)**  
  👉 https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-one-text-analyzer-cli

- **Day 2 — File Organizer Automation Tool**  
  👉 https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-two-file-organizer

- **Day 3 — Password Generator & Strength Checker**  
  👉 https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-three-password-tool

- **Day 4 — Weather Dashboard (API + JSON)**  
  👉 https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-four-weather-dashboard

- **Day 5 — Expense Tracker & CSV Report Generator**  
  👉 https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-five-expense-tracker

More utilities, organizers, and workflow-support tools are in development as I continue expanding my portfolio and capabilities.

My focus is on building **practical tools that support operations, documentation, and day-to-day technical workflows**.
