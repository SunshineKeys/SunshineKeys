🌞 **Hi, I’m Sunshine — Transitioning Into Remote Tech & Dev-Adjacent Work with a Technician’s Eye and a Service-Driven Work Ethic**

I’m moving into remote tech and dev-adjacent roles after years in positions where accuracy, communication, and reliability really mattered.

I spent 7+ years as a **Pharmacy Technician**, where I followed structured workflows, maintained precision in busy environments, and supported both teams and customers with care and consistency. My service and retail experience strengthened my adaptability, calm problem-solving style, and ability to stay steady under pressure.

Those experiences shape how I approach technical work today — with patience, curiosity, attention to detail, and a commitment to doing things the right way.

I’m still early in my Python journey, but I’m building practical skills that support real-world workflows, documentation, automation, and day-to-day technical operations.

🚀 **Projects & Learning Focus**

I’m currently working through an **8-Day Python Hireability Sprint**, building one project per day to develop structured thinking, problem-solving, and workflow automation foundations.

Completed so far:

* **Day 1 — Text Analyzer CLI** — 👉 View Project
* **Day 2 — File Organizer Automation Tool** — 👉 View Project
* **Day 3 — Password Generator & Strength Checker** — 👉 View Project
* **Day 4 — Weather Dashboard (API + JSON)** — 👉 View Project
* **Day 5 — Expense Tracker & CSV Report Generator** — 👉 View Project

More sprint projects — along with additional small organizers and automation utilities — are currently in progress.

My goal is to build simple, useful tools that support real-world tasks and technical operations.

🧰 **Technical Skills I’m Actively Building**

* Python fundamentals & clean, readable code
* File handling, CSV processing & text utilities
* Command-line tools & structured scripting
* API requests & JSON data handling
* Debugging and step-by-step troubleshooting
* Git & GitHub workflow practices
* Early automation & efficiency-focused thinking

I like understanding *why* something works — not just how to run it — and I’m developing that understanding one project at a time.

🌍 **Remote Work Readiness**

* Dedicated home workspace & focused daily schedule
* Comfortable working independently and asynchronously
* Experience following structured SOPs & workflow systems
* Strong written communication and documentation habits

I’m especially interested in roles such as:

* entry-level technical support / helpdesk
* operations or tooling support
* junior dev-adjacent roles
* QA / testing assistance
* data entry & workflow support
* automation-support / process-focused roles

I’m looking for opportunities where I can be dependable, helpful, and continuously learning while supporting teams and technical work.
