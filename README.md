 🌞 Hi, I’m Sunshine

I build practical Python projects with a focus on clean logic, clarity, and real-world usability. My work emphasizes readable code, structured problem-solving, and shipping functional tools — not just exercises.

I’m comfortable working in the command line, using Git and GitHub for version control, and breaking problems down into manageable, testable steps. I learn by building, refining, and improving projects end-to-end.
