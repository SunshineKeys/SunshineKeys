## 🎯 Why I'm Different

Most career changers talk about wanting to learn. **I’m already doing the work.**

- “I want to learn data analysis” → Built 3 analytics projects in 5 days  
- “I’m detail-oriented” → 7 years in pharmacy where data errors cost lives  
- “I learn fast” → Self-taught pandas, SQL-style analysis, and visualization in one week  

I don’t want a job around data. I want to solve business problems with analysis every day.

## 🌟 Why Healthcare → Data?

Seven years in pharmacy taught me that accuracy isn’t optional. I worked in high-volume environments where small data mistakes had serious consequences.

Same precision. Different domain.
