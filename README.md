# 🌞 Hi, I'm Megan — Python Developer

I build practical Python tools that solve real problems. My work emphasizes clean code, structured thinking, and shipping functional applications — not just exercises.

**Current focus:** Transitioning from 7 years in healthcare (Certified Pharmacy Technician) to technical roles in Python development, DevOps support, and QA automation.

## 🎉 8-Day Python Portfolio Sprint — COMPLETE!

I just completed an intensive 8-day sprint building one production-ready Python project per day. Each project demonstrates job-ready skills: file handling, API integration, data processing, CLI design, and automation.

**The Full Sprint:**

### **Day 1 — Text Analyzer CLI**  
Command-line tool for analyzing text files and extracting statistics (word count, character frequency, reading time)  
🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-one-text-analyzer-cli)

### **Day 2 — File Organizer Automation Tool**  
Automates file organization by sorting files into folders by type (images, documents, videos, etc.)  
🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-two-file-organizer)

### **Day 3 — Password Generator & Strength Checker**  
Generates secure passwords with customizable parameters and validates strength  
🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-three-password-tool)

### **Day 4 — Weather Dashboard (API + JSON)**  
Fetches live weather data using public API and displays 3-day forecast  
🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-four-weather-dashboard)

### **Day 5 — Expense Tracker & CSV Report Generator**  
Tracks expenses by category and exports detailed CSV reports for analysis  
🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-five-expense-tracker)

### **Day 6 — Task Manager (JSON Persistence)**  
Menu-driven task manager with status tracking and persistent JSON storage  
🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/SunshineKeys/Day-6-Task-Manager)

### **Day 7 — Log Analyzer Tool**  
Parses log files and counts entries by severity level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO)  
🔗 [View Project](https://github.com/SunshineKeys/day-seven-log-analyzer)

### **Day 8 — Job Application Tracker (CAPSTONE)**  
Tracks job applications with persistent storage — built to solve my own problem during job search

## 🧰 Technical Skills

**Language:** Python  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Command Line  
**Libraries:** requests, json, csv, datetime, collections  
**Concepts:** File I/O, API integration, data processing, error handling, CLI design, automation  

**From Healthcare Background:**
- 7 years as Certified Pharmacy Technician
- Experience with healthcare IT systems (Rx30, PioneerRx, QS/1)
- Understanding of HIPAA compliance and regulated environments
- Attention to detail where mistakes have serious consequences

## 💼 What I'm Looking For

**Entry-level roles in:**
- Python Development (Junior Developer, Associate Engineer)
- QA Automation (test automation with Python)
- DevOps Support (junior operations, tooling)
- Healthcare IT (combining tech + domain expertise)

**What I bring:**
- Self-taught Python developer with 8 portfolio projects
- Healthcare domain knowledge (pharmacy workflows, medical software)
- Strong attention to detail and process adherence
- Proven ability to learn complex systems independently
- Clear communicator who writes clean, maintainable code

## 🎯 Why I'm Different

Most career changers talk about their past. I'm building my future in public.

**Instead of saying "I want to learn Python"** → I built 8 Python projects in 8 days  
**Instead of saying "I'm detail-oriented"** → I spent 7 years in pharmacy where mistakes cost lives  
**Instead of saying "I can learn quickly"** → I taught myself Python and shipped working code  

I don't just want a job in tech. I want to solve problems with code every day.

## 🔧 Current Projects & Learning

**Completed:**
- ✅ 8-day Python portfolio sprint
- ✅ Self-directed Python fundamentals (Udemy 90-day bootcamp)
- ✅ Git/GitHub workflow proficiency
- ✅ CLI application design and deployment

**Next Steps:**
- Building more complex projects (web apps with Flask/Django)
- Practicing LeetCode problems for technical interviews
- Contributing to open source projects
- Learning Docker and basic DevOps tools
